   <h2 id="com">COMPUTER</h2>
   <h3> <a href="#go">go to top</a></h3>
    <p>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithematic and logical oprations.since a sequence of operations can be readily changed the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>
    
  <h4 id="cpu">CPU</h4>
    <p>A central processing unit(CPU),also known as central processor unit is a hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmatic,logical and input outout operations of the system.the term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s.the form,design and implementation of cpus have changed over the course of history </p>
  <h4 id="alu">ALU</h4>
    <p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs.</p>
 <h3 id="progm">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h3>
  <P>A programming language is a formal language designed to communicate instructions to a machine,particularly a computer.Programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine and to express algorithms precisely.</P>
 <h4 id="c">c<sup>++</sup></h4>
  <p>C++(pronounced see plus plus)is a programming language that is general purpose,statically typed,free form,multi-paradigm and compiled.it is regarded as an intermediate-level language,as it comprises both high-level and low-level language features</p>
 <h4 id="c">c</h4>
  <p>C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time,and C compilers are available for the majority of available computer architectures and operating systems.</p>
 <h3 id="dbms">DBMS</h3>
 <P>It is a computer software application that interacts with the user,other applications,and the database itself to capture and analyze the data.</P>
 <h3 id="rdbms">RDBMS</h3>
 <p>RDBMSs have been a common choice for the storage of information in new databases used for financial records,manufacturing and logistical information,personnel data,and other applications since the 1980s.</p>
